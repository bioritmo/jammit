this entire fork is only used to release the current (1/2/14) head of master of the original jammit gem so that bundler would fetch it using a Gemfile. The head currently contains a critical fix for Rails 4 which is not yet released on the main repository (I've opened an issue).

In the meantime, if you'd like to use my fork, simply add
```
gem 'jammit', :github => 'shaioz/jammit'
```
into your Gemfile instead of the current entry for jammit, and run

```
bundle update jammit
```

in your RoR app base folder.
